## Epsilon theme for Scriptogr.am ##

Epsilon is a responsive theme for the blogging platform Scriptogr.am. 

### Requirements ###

Although Scriptogr.am doesn't require that you to have your own web hosting, you will need some way of serving the CSS and JS files in this theme.

Since Scriptogr.am requires you have a Dropbox account, using your Dropbox public folder is the best way to do this. If you're not sure how to do this, see [Dropbox's help guide](https://www.dropbox.com/help/16/en). 

### Installation ###

1. Download the project files and copy the *epsilon* folder to your Dropbox public folder. 
2. Log in to Scriptogr.am, select *Tools > CSS editor* and clear the contents of it (we’re not using it). 
3. Copy the contents of the *index.html* from the *epsilon* folder into the HTML editor on Scriptogr.am.
4. Go to your Dropbox public folder, right click on the *style.css* file in the *epsilon* folder and  copy the public link. It’s usually along the lines of *https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1234567/Epsilon/style.css*
5. Update the paths for CSS and JS (labelled in the header section) using the public link. 
6. Save the HTML and that’s it.
